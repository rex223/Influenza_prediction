üöÄ Why PANDA Works
üõ°Ô∏è Preventive
A proactive approach to influenza surveillance ‚Äî moving beyond reaction, PANDA predicts outbreaks before they escalate.

üìä Analysis
Built on powerful ML algorithms like XGBoost and enhanced with fuzzy logic, PANDA delivers data-driven insights with accuracy and efficiency.

üåê Nationwide
Designed for scalability across India, PANDA supports multi-region deployment to help authorities respond faster, anywhere in the country.

ü¶† Disease Focused
Centering on influenza outbreak detection, PANDA keeps health at the core of its mission.

üîî Awareness
Empowering communities, health workers, and officials with timely alerts ‚Äî PANDA promotes vigilance and ‚Äújagrukta‚Äù at every level.

üêº PANDA isn't just a tool. It's a nationwide shield against outbreaks.

## 1. Project Overview

### Goal:
We are building a **Generalized Influenza Pandemic Warning System** that predicts the likelihood of an influenza pandemic in India, with a focus on **state-level analysis**. Our system will track and predict the spread of various influenza strains, including newly emerging ones, to provide early warnings.

## 2. What We Need to Build This System

To effectively track and predict influenza activity, we need to gather data from several sources. Here's the essential data we'll use:

### a. **Weekly or Monthly Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) Data**
- **Why**: ILI includes common symptoms like fever and cough, applicable to all influenza types (A, B, C) and new strains.
- **Where to Get It**: India's Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) or state health departments (e.g., Maharashtra health reports).
- **What It Helps With**: Spotting sudden rises in influenza cases, such as a rapid increase in ILI cases.

### b. **Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) Data**
- **Why**: SARI cases represent severe illness requiring hospitalization, often associated with influenza outbreaks.
- **Where to Get It**: IDSP or state health departments for hospital admission data.
- **What It Helps With**: Detecting if influenza is causing more severe illness, which could signal a pandemic.

### c. **Weather Information (Average Monthly Temperature)**
- **Why**: Influenza spreads more in cold, dry weather or during the monsoon season (e.g., January or August in India).
- **Where to Get It**: India Meteorological Department (IMD) for temperature, humidity, and rainfall data.
- **What It Helps With**: Understanding if weather conditions in 2026 could increase the spread of influenza.

### d. **Virus Type Information (for New Strains)**
- **Why**: New or more dangerous influenza strains (e.g., mutated H1N1 or new strains) could cause a pandemic.
- **Where to Get It**: National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) or global databases like WHO‚Äôs FluNet.
- **What It Helps With**: Monitoring the appearance of new, fast-spreading influenza strains.

### e. **Hospital and Healthcare Data**
- **Why**: A surge in influenza cases could overwhelm hospitals, turning an outbreak into a full-scale crisis.
- **Where to Get It**: State health departments or IDSP for hospital bed and ICU data.
- **What It Helps With**: Evaluating if hospitals are prepared for a potential surge in cases.

### f. **Population and Travel Data**
- **Why**: High population density and frequent travel (e.g., during festivals like Diwali) increase the speed at which influenza spreads.
- **Where to Get It**: Census of India for population data, and Indian Railways for travel trends.
- **What It Helps With**: Identifying high-risk states, like Maharashtra, with large populations and frequent movement.

### g. **Pigs Vaccination Data**
- **Why**: Vaccination of pigs can reduce the chances of zoonotic influenza strains affecting humans.
- **Where to Get It**: Local veterinary health data and government reports.
- **What It Helps With**: Understanding the level of protection against zoonotic strains.

## 3. How We‚Äôll Use This Information

We will combine all this data to build a **warning system** capable of predicting if a pandemic is likely in 2026. Here's how it works:

- **Tracking ILI**: Weekly ILI data will be monitored to track overall influenza activity.
- **Rapid Increases**: We‚Äôll look for rapid increases in ILI cases (e.g., cases doubling in a few weeks).
- **Severe Illness**: We‚Äôll track SARI data to identify any severe illness spikes.
- **New Strains**: We will monitor NCDC for reports of new influenza strains.
- **Weather Impact**: We'll check the weather to see if conditions in 2026 could increase influenza spread.
- **Healthcare Capacity**: Hospital and ICU data will help us assess the ability of healthcare systems to handle a surge.
- **State-Level Risk Assessment**: We'll evaluate high-risk states, considering population density and travel patterns.

### Example:
If we see ILI cases in **Maharashtra** jump from **1,000** to **3,000** in three weeks during **January 2026**, the weather is **cold and dry**, hospitals are **nearly full**, and NCDC reports a **new influenza strain**, our system will issue an early **pandemic warning**.

## 4. Planned Features

- **State Cases to Population Ratio**: We will use this ratio to determine the relative risk of influenza outbreaks across states.
- **Allocated Influenza Cases**: The system will predict allocated influenza cases across different states to forecast potential outbreaks.
- **Integrated Data Sources**: The system will automatically integrate data from various sources for a holistic view of the influenza threat.

### Let's build a robust system to track and predict **influenza pandemics** with real-time data, keeping India prepared for any unexpected outbreak!

**Note**: Many datasets were not available, so we had to make do with whatever we could access, ensuring the system works with the best data at hand.
